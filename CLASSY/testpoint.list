# This is the OSSOS survey description file.
#
# All lines starting with '#' are ignored, so they are used for comments
#
# Each data line has the format:
# <width> <height> <RA> <DEC> <epoch> <filling_factor> <tracked_fraction> \
#   <obs_code> <efficiency_file_name>
#
# <width>: width of FOV, in degree
# <height>: height of FOV, in degree
# <RA>: Right Ascension of pointing, decimal degree or HH:MM:SS[.ss...]
# <DEC>: Declination of pointing, decimal degree or DD:MM:SS[.ss...]
# <epoch>: epoch of pointing, in Julian day (decimal)
# <filling_factor>: filling factor of that FOV
# <obs_code>: observatory code
# <efficiency_file_name>: name of efficiency file for that pointing
#
# For Megaprime, the 36 CCDs are 2048x4612 with pixels 0.18689x0.18689", so
# assuming a total footprint of 1 sq.deg, the filling factor is 0.9164
#
# 2013A-E block
#
# From JJ's e-mail on Dec. 2nd, 2014, there were 7 chips out of 756 that had
# a PSF problem, thus the pipeline did not run to the end. All other cases
# had good trans.jmp files and completed correctly. So effective surface
# area is 749/756 = 99.07%, so filling factor is 0.9907*0.9164=0.9079
